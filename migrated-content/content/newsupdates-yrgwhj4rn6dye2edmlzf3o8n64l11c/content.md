# PICC Photography Inspiring Children In Conservation

## BATWA FARM PROJECT IN MATANDA NEAR KIHIHI

## Batwa Farm Project at Kihihi, Uganda

In September of 2021 Paul Kirui delivered new digital cameras, lenses and a projector to a school for orphans in Bwindi, Uganda.  Some of the cameras were simple Canon digital cameras and others were high end Cannon Rebel T7 mirrorless cameras with zoom lenses.

One of the goals of our foundation was to have the students and teachers at the school learn photography so that they can take photos of visiting guests, members of their community, wildlife in the nearby forest, and other interesting components in their environment and culture.   We believe it will be wonderful for the students to experience being both the subject of others photos and also to be the photographer!

During the summer of 2022 Kathy West and her team began working with the students and teachers to begin the learning associated with PICC at Bwindi, Uganda.  Rafiki, PICC and the school have the ongoing support of our foundation as they develop this innovative and important learning opportunity and experience for the students!
