The primary aim of this project was to preserve and rehabilitate the delicate alpine ecosystems of Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone in the Mount Everest region. The area's degradation has occurred due to excessive grazing, the excessive harvesting of alpine shrubs for fuelwood, and inadequate conservation practices. Additionally, global warming and climate change have had a particularly negative impact on the Khumbu region, which includes Mt. Everest. Similarly, to alleviate the consequences of climate change, a key strategy for adapting to climate change is to maximize tree planting in various locations.",

Forests provide crucial advantages such as unpolluted air, diverse ecosystems, and sources of income for millions of people around the globe. Under the guidance of Dr. Les Omotani, we effectively proceeded with the cultivation of indigenous trees in Khunde village, situated at an elevation of 3840m. Tree planting offers a multitude of benefits to both the environment and the local community. The program fosters cooperation among Sherpa communities, tourists, the government, benefactors [such as the Omotani Caring Foundation], and organizations to safeguard alpine ecosystems. Community members can contribute to forest preservation by participating in the exchange of information.",
