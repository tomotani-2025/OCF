1.         ONE DAY ONE TREE IN SAGARMATHA NATIONAL PARK AND BUFFER ZONE

In 2016, The Partners Nepal initiated the "Community-based Alpine Conservation and Restoration Project" in Pangboche, with initial funding from Sir Edmund Hillary Stiftung Deutschland in Germany. The primary aim of this project was to preserve and rehabilitate the delicate alpine ecosystems of Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone in the Mount Everest region. The area's degradation has occurred due to excessive grazing, the excessive harvesting of alpine shrubs for fuelwood, and inadequate conservation practices. Additionally, global warming and climate change have had a particularly negative impact on the Khumbu region, which includes Mt. Everest. Similarly, to alleviate the consequences of climate change, a key strategy for adapting to climate change is to maximize tree planting in various locations.

The Partners Nepal understands the critical importance. Forests are essential for the maintenance of life on our planet. Forests provide crucial advantages such as unpolluted air, diverse ecosystems, and sources of income for millions of people around the globe. Under the guidance of Dr. Les Omotani, we effectively proceeded with the cultivation of indigenous trees in Khunde village, situated at an elevation of 3840m. Tree planting offers a multitude of benefits to both the environment and the local community. The program fosters cooperation among Sherpa communities, tourists, the government, benefactors [such as the Omotani Caring Foundation], and organizations to safeguard alpine ecosystems. Community members can contribute to forest preservation by participating in the exchange of information.

2.          IN CHESKAM VILLAGE, THE PARTNERS NEPAL SUPPORTS COMMUNITY PONDS AS CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION

In 2023, The Partners Nepal constructed a community pond in Chheskam, Mahakulung Rural Municipality-1, Solukhumbu, to mitigate the effects of climate change. Climate adaptation requires the utilization of a communal pond. As global communities work towards sustainable solutions for climate change, initiatives such as these are vital milestones towards a more resilient future. This community pond is crucial to adapting to climate change and enhancing environmental resilience. By establishing and upkeeping these miniature aquatic habitats, we actively contribute to reducing global warming, preserving ecosystems, and promoting community involvement in conservation endeavors. Conserving these areas enhances, broadens, and stabilizes the ecological reactions to climate change. Climate change is responsible for droughts and storms, which require the implementation of water management strategies. Effective management of rainwater through neighborhood ponds can help mitigate droughts. Let us persist in advocating for creative solutions and environmentally friendly practices to benefit our planet and future generations.

3.          SIR EDMUND HILLARY MEMORIAL AND ELDERLY CARE CENTER IN BUNG

In 2016, we received a request from the residents of Bung to assist in conserving and revitalizing a building damaged by the earthquake in 2015. In 1989, Sir Edmund Hillary constructed a clinic in this village to offer healthcare services to the local community, who previously had to travel a considerable distance to reach either Phaplu Hospital or Khunde Hospital, also established by Sir Edmund Hillary. Thanks to financial assistance from the Sir Edmund Hillary Stiftung Deutschland, The Partners Nepal has successfully reconstructed the clinic that was devastated by the earthquake in 2015. Additionally, they have provided extensive aid in the form of shelters for elderly citizens who lack caretakers.

Thanks to the financial assistance provided by Drs. Les and Barbara Omotani: The Omotani Caring Foundation, we have utilized the funds to procure therapy equipment for the Elderly Care Centre. Individuals utilize the Nuga Best Massage Bed for therapeutic purposes and relaxation. It aids in maintaining proper spinal alignment, promotes muscle relaxation, and facilitates blood purification. Korean Jade Spine Heating Mats and massage beds are essential as acupressure benefits one's well-being. Massage therapy has the potential to alleviate stress, anxiety, and tension, relax muscles, reduce chronic pain, and enhance blood circulation. As mentioned earlier, providing seniors with the Nuga Best Massage Bed or Therapy will facilitate their acquisition of the advantages.
