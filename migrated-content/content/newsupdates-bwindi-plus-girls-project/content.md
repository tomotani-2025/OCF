Bwindi Plus Girls Project

The Girls Project is being implemented by Elizabeth as the Principal of the Bwindi Plus Orphanage School.  In Bwindi, a variety of social and economic conditions exist that make it challenging for young girls to attend and remain in school on a regular basis.

The project’s aim objective is to empower girls in schools through hands on training and free supply of menstrual health products so its open to every girl who is 8 years of age and older. The girls usually have 30 minutes for hands training and practice in making pads, uniforms, sweaters.   The girls learn skills and also benefit from the finished products.

Discussions are occurring with other schools to allow some of the girls join us for 30 min to get training and practice in the skills.

Elizabeth’s  dream is to make it a bigger project to give opportunities to more girls in the village.  She remembers her own personal challenges as a young girl trying to get a great education.  Her life is dedicated to helping orphans and especially young girls receive a quality education and to live a great life!

With the latest donation from OCF  an additional 200 girls have been provided with sanitary pads. The project places  4 pieces in each pack.  These pads are given out free of charge to encourage the girls stay in school and appreciate who they are as young women.   With this project we continue our support of projects focused upon education, sustainable food sources and health initiatives for children.

Elizabeth identifies the following goals and successes for the project:

1.Reduces School Dropouts: Provides girls with necessary resources, enabling them to attend school comfortably during menstruation.

2. Promotes Menstrual Health: Encourages proper hygiene, reducing risks of reproductive infections.

3. Environmental Benefits: Reusable pads minimize disposable pad waste, protecting the environment.

4. Cost-Effective: Long-term savings for families, as reusable pads last up to 2-3 years.

5. Empowers Girls: Boosts confidence, self-esteem, and participation in education.

6. Breaks Menstrual Taboos: Fosters open discussions, normalizing menstruation.

7. Improves Health Education: Integrates reproductive health awareness.

N.B: we have so far supplied to the following schools

1. Bwindi plus girls 130

2. Buhoma community primary 60 girls

3. St Mathew primary 36 girls

4. Bwindi junior primary 70 girls
