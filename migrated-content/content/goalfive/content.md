# Goal Five:  Fresh Water

#### FRESH WATER = $5,000

#### Access to daily fresh drinking water remains a challenge for underserved Native American families throughout the USA and in remote villages throughout the world..The foundation provides support to local families and groups who address this need by drilling fresh water wells, providing water treatment systems, transport fresh drinking water using tanker trucks or provide fresh drinking water using alternative strategies such as water storage tanks and pipelines.
