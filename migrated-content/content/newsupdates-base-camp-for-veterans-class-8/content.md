BASE CAMP FOR VETERANS

Class 8 of BCI was able to participate in an extensive week of equine therapy from May 19 – 26, 2024.  Four (4) dedicated and wonderful veterans were able to work with the mustangs and also participate in riding activities offered at the White Stallion Ranch.

The Omotani Caring Foundation continues to be grateful for the service and sacrifice given by our veterans and are ready to continue to support BASE CAMP FOR VETERANS.  We are especially pleased to support the continued involvement of Randy Helm as the lead mustang trainer and facilitator with the veterans participating in BCI.

On June 23, 2024 a reunion day was held at the White Stallion Ranch for participants from previous classes.  All of the veterans [and family members] openly share the positive effect Base Camp for Veterans is having on their transition from military service to civilian life.
