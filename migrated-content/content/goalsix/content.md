# Goal Six:  Education

#### K-12 EDUCATION = $5,000

#### Children who live in poverty and/or require special education support services exist throughout the United States and the world. The foundation provides support for Native American children, inner city children and children who live in remote wilderness locations who need additional support.  The OCF has provided support and consultation for others wishing to support schools in the US and throughout the world.

#### The foundation collaborates with existing educational and community leaders and staff who have demonstrated successful interventions that result in improved educational experiences for the children.
