Celebrating 100th Anniversary of the Tucson Rodeo

The Omotani Caring Foundation is happy to continue its support of the Tucson Rodeo and the many charities supported by the rodeo and its leaders.  The Tucson Rodeo Vaquero Club is a wonderful way to celebrate the spirit of the Tucson Rodeo.  We give thanks and extend our appreciation for the caring and giving provided by Jose Calderon.

In 2025 we were very happy and grateful to support the participation of Base Camp for Veterans in addition to several of our friends who represent a long history of horsemanship, ranching, support for veterans and first responders and least resistance training of wild mustangs.
