# PORTER BEES AND CHICKEN PROJECT AT NYAMBISHAMBA - SEPTEMBER PROGRESS REPORT

## Distribution of flour and beans from first harvest

## BATWA FARM AT MATANDA - SECOND PLANTING

Robert Tweheyo [Bwindi Batwa Farms and Rafiki Memorial Wildlife Conservation Initiative] visited Milton Byamukama and other porters in the Nyambishamba association, to observe the progress of the beehives and chickens projects.

The chickens are being very well fed [though they eat a lot] and the Nyambishamba porters now have one hundred and two (102)  chickens.

When the chicken starts laying eggs, the porters will use nest boxes for each of them.  They hope and expect them to start laying eggs by the end of September or early October.

The photos show Milton, Robert, Denis [Secretary], Fred Budara (Mutwa), Julius Disciplinary [committee member] and Alex [who is the main porter who takes care of the bees by giving them water and growing the plants with flowers for the bees to obtain nectar.

As of September, the porters have added (30) thirty beehives to the project.

The projects are continuing to make good progress and we are looking forward to future success!
