# Goal Eleven:  Randy Helm Horsemanship

#### We are pleased to support Randy Helm and his continuing work to train wild mustangs and to support a wide variety of people to learn how to be good and great horsemanship learners and riders.  Randy has successfully led the State of Arizona’s Wild Horse Inmate program and is a facilitator with Base Camp for Veterans.  He also leads amazing horsemanship and riding clinics throughout the United States.

#### TRAINING OF WILD MUSTANGS FOR FOREVER HOMES

#### We are fortunate to know several trainers and ranchers who are dedicated to the positive transformational approach to training wild mustangs and preparing them for new forever homes.

#### Too many mustangs are destined for starvation due to limited grazing land or are sold to slaughter factories and meat packing plants [often located in Mexico].

#### Mustangs can be transitioned from the wild and they successfully learn how to become amazing trained horses for a wide variety of riders.

#### In the near future we hope to announce additional and new opportunities that benefit the wild mustangs and their trainers.
