---

### The Omotani Caring Foundation is used to support specific charitable, educational, medical, conservation, scientific and humanitarian purposes.We collaborate with caring supporters to address the needs and projects that are identified by local people in the USA and specific regions of the world.  When directly asked by individuals we may provide caring citizens, who reside in the United States of America ,with an easy, legal and trustworthy process to donate and support deserving children and families.

#### We do NOT actively solicit donations.  We personally fund over 95% of the OCF projects and activities.

#### All funds donated by family, friends and others [100%] are transferred and used to complete the designated project(s).

#### We encourage you to become involved with our projects by giving of your time and talents.  Again, we do not actively solicit funding for our projects.  The trustees independently and personally  pay for all administrative, accounting and legal fees.
