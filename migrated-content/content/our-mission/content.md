The Omotani Caring Foundation [OCF] has purchased approximately 10 acres of very fertile and productive farmland at Matanda [near Kihihi] Uganda.  In collaboration with the Rafiki  Memorial Wildlife Conservation Initiative this new farming project will involve and support Batwa families from the Kibirangwe, Nyabisiika, Mukongoro and Karehe settlements.  Leaders, elders, youth, and other family representatives from each settlement have visited the farm land and have voluntarily agreed to be a participant in this project.   [In the future, additional Batwa settlements may be added to this project.]

Tweheyo Robert and Mushamba Moses will provide the training and support leadership for this farm project.  Sahaya International continues its positive partnership with the Omotani Caring Foundation in support of children and families in the Bwindi and Buhoma region.

During the Covid pandemic the loss of tourism revenue and visitors and the shutdown of various activities in rural Uganda caused great challenges and food shortages among the Batwa families and settlements.  The Omotani Caring Foundation purchased and distributed food supplies to the Bwindi Plus School, local porters and several Batwa families during these past years.

The OCF has decided to refocus its priority projects in the Bwindi region to provide support for projects that will allow the Batwa and porters to develop new and increased sources of food self-sufficiency and food security for the future.

In 2022 the OCF distributed over $23,000 USD to purchase approximately 10 acres of fertile farm land at Matanda [near Kihihi] Uganda.    In 2023 an additional $4,000 USD will be distributed to fund the clearing, leveling  and preparation of the land for planting, the purchase of farming tools and seeds, supporting workers for during the planting activity by construction of huts, transportation and meals.

Support the development and expansion of food related sustainability project that will allow the porters in one of the four major  porter’s association to supplement the income they receive from tourism.

This project will be  coordinated with the support and project accountability controls of the Rafiki Wildlife Conservation Initiative.

The OCF will  provide small annual grants to purchase bees for honey and chickens for eggs. A few of the porters have already established 35 bee hives that are producing honey.  This project will start with one porter association [Bwindi Bujengwe Porters Association] and if the first project is successful, we may expand to include members of additional porter associations in the future.

Develop an emergency reserve fund of $5,000 to be used for future purchases and distribution of foods rich in protein such as maize / corn flour, beans and fruits. Also provide for the purchase of soap, masks, medicine and other emergency supplies.

During the 2020 Covid pandemic, individual amounts ranging from $1,000 - $1,500 and totaling over $10,000 USD supported the purchase and distribution of food, soap and medical supplies to students and their families, teachers, Batwa families, and porters in nearby villages.

Additional private grant donations were made, during the Covid pandemic,  to additional NGO and travel expedition adventure companies who supported local guides and staff throughout the world.

In 2019 - 2022 the OCF provided over $3,500 USD in funding to support the first computers, printers and digital cameras to be used by school children in Bwindi, Uganda.

In the future grants will be made to support similar projects in the USA, Canada and other regions of the world.

Specifically, the OCF will continue to provide a limited number of high quality digital mirrorless cameras and lenses, Go Pro video cameras, and digital webinars, instructional software and color print materials to support older students being able to learn and practice the basic and advanced skills and art of photography.

Very few local students or adults in remote regions of the world  learn the skills necessary to become a professional photographer. Ironically visitors travel from throughout the world  travel to remote lands and countries to photograph the natural environment and wildlife and the children.

In partnership with organizations such as Photography Inspiring Children in Conservation [PICC] allow the students to learn photography and use visual photos and videos to tell their stories.    In the future we will continue to support the work of PICC and others to encourage children all over the world to develop their skills as photographers and conservationists.

We support Fresh Water and Education programs for Native American families and children who live in poverty and/or remote villages throughout the United States and the world.

Access to daily fresh drinking water remains a challenge for underserved Native American families throughout the USA and villages throughout the world.The foundation provides support to local families and groups who address this need by drilling fresh water wells, providing water treatment systems, transport fresh drinking water using tanker trucks or provide fresh drinking water using alternative strategies such as water storage tanks and pipelines.

K-12 and Higher education

Children who live in poverty and/or require special education support services exist throughout the United States and the world.

The OCF has provided tuition fees for one orphan student in Bwindi for her entire elementary education.  A second Batwa student’s tuition is paid each year.  Additional support is being provided for local Batwa education initiatives.

The foundation provides support for Native American children, inner city children, visible minorities and children who live in remote wilderness locations who need additional support. The foundation collaborates with existing educational and community leaders and staff who have demonstrated successful interventions that result in improved educational experiences for the children.

Base Camp for Veterans.   BCI

BaseCamp for Veterans, Inc. ("BCI") was founded by life-long friends Deborah Plum & Theo Windish, who each have experience in both the private and public sectors, and who have spent a significant portion of their professional lives connecting people, being a part of charitable groups, and investing their time in projects that served a variety of communities.

​The desire to create something sustainable that truly gives back to generations of people, combined with a palpable awareness of the noticeable decline in comprehensive veteran services, particularly ones that include families as part of the process, led Theo and Deborah to conclude that the veteran community was where they needed to focus their energy.

​Our Mission: To respond to the needs of those who serve our nation and protect its values, by promoting personal and professional growth, and contributing to an effective, sustainable path towards reintegration.​

https://www.bcampinc.com/about

https://www.facebook.com/BaseCampforVeteransInc

The Omotani Caring Foundation [OCF] has been pleased to provide support to BCI for 2024, 2025 and beyond.  In particular we have supported the work of the mustang trainer, Randy Helm, and his work with introducing the veterans to the unique connection available with mustangs.

We are pleased to support Randy Helm and his continuing work to train wild mustangs and to support a wide variety of people to learn how to be good and great horsemanship learners and riders.  Randy has successfully led the State of Arizona’s Wild Horse Inmate program and is a facilitator with Base Camp for Veterans.  He also leads amazing horsemanship and riding clinics throughout the United States.

TRAINING OF WILD MUSTANGS FOR FOREVER HOMES

We are fortunate to know several trainers and ranchers who are dedicated to the positive transformational approach to training wild mustangs and preparing them for new forever homes.

Too many mustangs are destined for starvation due to limited grazing land or are sold to slaughter factories and meat packing plants [often located in Mexico].

Mustangs can be transitioned from the wild and they successfully learn how to become amazing trained horses for a wide variety of riders.

In the near future we hope to announce additional and new opportunities that benefit the wild mustangs and their trainers.

The Omotani Caring Foundation is pleased to become a supporter of the High Asia Habitat Fund.  The founder of HAHF, Behzad Larry, is committed to the conservation of the snow leopards and other wildlife in the region.  HAHF is also supporting the training of local people to help them and their cattle coexist with wildlife in the remote regions of the high Himalayan mountains.

Current study and exploration is being planned and conducted to determine whether brown bears can become a valued natural resource for future tourism and conservation.

Plans have been made to travel directly to the Ladakh [and possibly the Kargill] region of India, with Voygr Expeditions,  to observe and learn how to provide additional meaningful support for these projects.

In the near future we hope to announce additional and new opportunities that benefit the wild mustangs and their trainers.

          The Omotani Caring Foundation is pleased to become a supporter of the High Asia Habitat Fund.  The founder of HAHF, Behzad Larry, is committed to the conservation of the snow leopards and other wildlife in the region.  HAHF is also supporting the training of local people to help them and their cattle coexist with wildlife in the remote regions of the high Himalayan mountains.   Current study and exploration is being planned and conducted to determine whether brown bears can become a valued natural resource for future tourism and conservation.Plans have been made to travel directly to the Ladakh [and possibly the Kargill] region of India, with Voygr Expeditions,  to observe and learn how to provide additional meaningful support for these projects. https://highasiafund.orghttps://voygr.com/
