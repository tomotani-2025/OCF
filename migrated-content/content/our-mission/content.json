In collaboration with the Rafiki  Memorial Wildlife Conservation Initiative this new farming project will involve and support Batwa families from the Kibirangwe, Nyabisiika, Mukongoro and Karehe settlements.  Leaders, elders, youth, and other family representatives from each settlement have visited the farm land and have voluntarily agreed to be a participant in this project.   [In the future, additional Batwa settlements may be added to this project.]   Tweheyo Robert and Mushamba Moses will provide the training and support leadership for this farm project.  Sahaya International continues its positive partnership with the Omotani Caring Foundation in support of children and families in the Bwindi and Buhoma region.   During the Covid pandemic the loss of tourism revenue and visitors and the shutdown of various activities in rural Uganda caused great challenges and food shortages among the Batwa families and settlements.  The Omotani Caring Foundation purchased and distributed food supplies to the Bwindi Plus School, local porters and several Batwa families during these past years.   The OCF has decided to refocus its priority projects in the Bwindi region to provide support for projects that will allow the Batwa and porters to develop new and increased sources of food self-sufficiency and food security for the future.   In 2022 the OCF distributed over $23,000 USD to purchase approximately 10 acres of fertile farm land at Matanda [near Kihihi] Uganda.    In 2023 an additional $4,000 USD will be distributed to fund the clearing, leveling  and preparation of the land for planting, the purchase of farming tools and seeds, supporting workers for during the planting activity by construction of huts, transportation and meals."

Specifically, the OCF will continue to provide a limited number of high quality digital mirrorless cameras and lenses, Go Pro video cameras, and digital webinars, instructional software and color print materials to support older students being able to learn and practice the basic and advanced skills and art of photography.   Very few local students or adults in remote regions of the world  learn the skills necessary to become a professional photographer. Ironically visitors travel from throughout the world  travel to remote lands and countries to photograph the natural environment and wildlife and the children.    In partnership with organizations such as Photography Inspiring Children in Conservation [PICC] allow the students to learn photography and use visual photos and videos to tell their stories.    In the future we will continue to support the work of PICC and others to encourage children all over the world to develop their skills as photographers and conservationists.  https://www.facebook.com/PICCconservation/"

Randy has successfully led the State of Arizona’s Wild Horse Inmate program and is a facilitator with Base Camp for Veterans.  He also leads amazing horsemanship and riding clinics throughout the United States.  https://www.azcowboyministries.com/page/helm-horsemanship-1 https://www.facebook.com/helmhorsemanship/ TRAINING OF WILD MUSTANGS FOR FOREVER HOMES We are fortunate to know several trainers and ranchers who are dedicated to the positive transformational approach to training wild mustangs and preparing them for new forever homes. Too many mustangs are destined for starvation due to limited grazing land or are sold to slaughter factories and meat packing plants [often located in Mexico]. Mustangs can be transitioned from the wild and they successfully learn how to become amazing trained horses for a wide variety of riders. In the near future we hope to announce additional and new opportunities that benefit the wild mustangs and their trainers."
