## BASE CAMP FOR VETERANS and RANDY HELM HORSEMANSHIP

Randy Helm Horsemanship is focused on horse training in clinics, demonstrations, and expos. The clinics are usually 2 to 3-day events with horses and riders.

Whether clinics or expos, we focus on becoming a safe, confident rider with a responsive, safe horse.Randy has conducted clinics and expos for numerous organizations such as Arizona State Prison, US Border Patrol, Law Enforcement, and of course the general public.

Randy’s support and leadership with BaseCamp for Veterans and his ongoing support for the graduates of the Arizona Prison Inmate Horsemanship program combine his passion for helping wild mustangs and deserving people to find a great future through the learning of horsemanship!

The Omotani Caring Foundation is grateful for the opportunity to support and also benefit from Randy Helm Horsemanship.

I really can't say enough about the riders in the clinic this past weekend. Some weather issues and arena issues didn't seem to hamper the enthusiasm and passion. Everyone worked hard and had a great attitude. It ended up being one of my favorite clinics ever.   We were very fortunate to be participants in this Randy Helm Horsemanship clinic.  We look forward to continuing our learning and collaboration journey with Randy Helm Horsemanship.
