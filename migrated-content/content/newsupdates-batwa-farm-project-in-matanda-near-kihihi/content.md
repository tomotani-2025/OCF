# BATWA FARM PROJECT IN MATANDA NEAR KIHIHI

## Borneo Rainforest and Gayana Marine Reserve  - October 2022

## PICC Photography Inspiring Children In Conservation

The farming project at Matanda, near Kihihi,  is proposed to start in March of 2023. The farming will be in phases, the first phase will be land preparation followed by clearing and planting seedlings of different types of crops.

Preparation of land is the first step, as it’s a new farmland containing strong grass, it will require the need of a digging tractor that has to dig deep underground for a very good farm and suitable growth of crops.

Land clearing will involve using hand hoes and manual labor to clear and remove some particles that are hardly seen by the digging tractor. It will also involve leveling and mapping different parts specifically for a certain type of crop

After clearing and making partials, planting of seeds and stems will start, for the first phase of crops will include maize, beans, cassava and sweet potatoes as we continue learning the fertility and best crops for the farm
