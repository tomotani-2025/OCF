## STUDENT PHOTOGRAPHERS: THE ADVENTURE BEGINS

During the years of the Covid 19 pandemic the OCF learned of  the urgent need to feed the children as a priority and urgent need.  .  Many of the children at schools do not have sponsors.  We are happy to support another food purchase and distribution that continues to support the school’s students and teachers and many Batwa families.

We encourage everyone to consider planning a future visit to the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, to trek to be among the mountain gorillas in their bamboo rain forest and also to spend time with the children and teachers at the Bwindi schools.  You will return home with memories that will enhance your life forever!

The short video below is from our Batwa friends who we have been supporting since March of 2020.  It is wonderful to hear their singing voices and to see their smiles during these challenging times!
