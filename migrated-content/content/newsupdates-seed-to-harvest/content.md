# SEED TO HARVEST

## HARVEST at the Batwa farm at Matanda

## BWINDI NYAMBISHAMBA PORTER CHICKEN AND EGG POULTRY PROJECT

In the beginning all that existed was a dream of a better future…

And the hope that the hard work of farming by hand would yield a good harvest…

And the sun and the rain and more weeding with hoes by hand allowed the crops to grow…

The first crop to be harvested in July will be corn/maize….

This is living proof that dreams do come true!
