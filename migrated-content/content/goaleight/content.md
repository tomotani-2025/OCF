# Goal Eight:  The Partners Nepal = Strengthening Relationships

#### Drs. Les and Barbara Omotani [The Omotani Caring Foundation] met Ang Rita Sherpa and Peter Hillary during a 2014 National Geographic Expedition adventure to the Faulkland Islands, South Georgia Island and Antarctica.  Throughout the years, Barbara and Les Omotani have provided private donations to support the work of THE PARTNERS NEPAL [TPN].

#### Ang Rita Sherpa worked for the US National Park service for several years and returned to Nepal with a vision of sharing how Nepal might adopt some of the basic foundation principles and practices of the US parks system.  The Partners Nepal is a non-profit, Non-Government Organization [NGO] registered in the Solukhumbu, Province No 1 in Nepal.

#### The TPN web site (below) describes the members of the team in Nepal, the main projects and publications of the organization.  TPN has a solid record of good financial management of donor funds and quality planning and completion of projects.  Regular reports are created and published in a timely manner.

#### The goal for networking and collaboration

#### One of the primary goals of strengthening our relationship with The Partners Nepal [TPN] is to provide US citizens with an easy and legal way to donate funds to a US 501 c 3, support the projects and work of TPN and qualify for federal tax credits.

#### The Omotani Caring Foundation will serve as a key communicator and link to The Partners Nepal.  We are also pleased to share that Sahaya International, with the support and leadership of Koen Van Rompay, will serve as the primary donation site in the USA for US citizens who wish to support the work of The Partners Nepal and also receive the benefits of a US federal tax credit.   The federal tax ID number for Sahaya International is 68-0434770.

#### All US donors are encouraged to use the existing on-line donation process of the Sahaya International web site.  Please indicate in writing that your donation is to support THE PARTNERS NEPAL project(s).   100% of the funds donated to THE PARTNERS NEPAL will be forwarded to TPN for use in supporting their projects.

#### Of course, individuals who do not wish to donate to a registered US 501 c 3 charity, remain able to send funds directly to The Partners Nepal.

#### The goals of The Partners Nepal and Sahaya International and The Omotani Caring Foundation are very much in agreement with each other.

#### We encourage all US supporters to access the web site of THE PARTNERS NEPAL to develop an understanding of their important work in Nepal.
