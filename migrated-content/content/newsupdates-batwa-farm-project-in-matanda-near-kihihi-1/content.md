# BATWA FARM PROJECT [at Matanda] PREPARES LAND FOR PLANTING

## From seeds to vibrant plants for food!

## Borneo Rainforest and Gayana Marine Reserve  - October 2022

The farming project at Matanda, near Kihihi,  has started with the first phase of land preparation followed by clearing and planting seedlings of different types of crops.

The new farm has very fertile soil and a digging tractor is being used to dig deep underground to properly prepare the soil for planting and the growth and harvesting of crops.

After clearing and making partials, planting of seeds and stems will start, for the first phase of crops will include maize, beans, cassava and sweet potatoes as we continue learning the fertility and best crops for the farm.   Members of the Batwa families and settlements are an integral part of the future success of the new farm.  They willingly participate in the clearing and preparation of the land for planting of the new crops.  A future leading to food independence and sustainability starts today.

Project coordinated by Rafiki Memorial Wildlife Conservation Initiative
