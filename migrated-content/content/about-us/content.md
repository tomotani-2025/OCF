The Omotani Caring Foundation welcomes Brad Josephs to serve as its USA and International Advisor.  Specifically, Brad will share his knowledge, expertise and insights that support the conservation of brown bears and the training of local people to work as guides, spotters, local tourism support and other roles in the high Himalayan mountains of India and throughout the USA.  We believe that Brad can lead the conservation efforts of the high Himalayan brown bear as a keystone umbrella species and engage the local people as full participants in the development of a successful and comprehensive nature tourism initiative.

Brad has been a professional naturalist guide, wildlife photographer and wildlife expedition leader since he graduated from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks with a B.S. in wildlife biology in 1999. For over two decades, Brad has guided numerous professional photographers, photography workshops, bear viewers and film crews on expeditions to view coastal brown bears along the remote Coast of Katmai National Park, Alaska, and wildlife expeditions in China and Borneo. Brad is and has always been obsessed with encouraging wildlife and wilderness conservation in all corners of the world.

Most recently, Brad has chased his life-long fantasy of seeing snow leopards in the wild in the Indian Himalayas and Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China. He guides and leads Voygr’s snow leopard expeditions and helps local herders build predator proof corrals to keep their cattle safe. The OCF is supporting THE HIGH ASIA HABITAT FUND and its mission of protecting the Himalayan snow leopards, the local people and the future successful conservation of the high Himalayan brown bears through responsible tourism. https://highasiafund.org

When not traveling for work, Brad keeps busy as a freelance wildlife writer/photographer/videographer, consultant for wildlife film projects, and lectures at schools, government agencies and organizations on natural history and bear biology and safety. Brad’s hobbies include botany, gardening, bird watching, fly fishing and canoeing in the Ozarks of Arkansas where he recently moved from Alaska. Brad is also a former EMT with the Homer, Alaska fire department, and is a certified Wilderness First Responder.
