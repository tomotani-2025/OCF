# Borneo Rainforest and Gayana Marine Reserve  - October 2022 — Omotani CARING Foundation

> Borneo Rainforest and Gayana Marine Reserve

October 2022 by Les Omotani

Throughout the world we get to meet individuals who are making a 
significant difference in sustaining the endangered wildlife in our 
rainforests, oceans and remote islands. Our travels to the Borneo 
rainforest, in October of 2022, were focused upon finding orangutans in 
their natural habitat. What we discovered was many local people engaged in 
small but important efforts to protect and sustain several endangered 
species. We also continued to find amazing efforts to provide all children 
with a quality education.

We were impressed with the efforts of the Turtle Nest Adoption program at 
Sabah Parks.

We also were happy to meet Dr. Wong Siew Te at his Bornean Sun Bear 
Conservation Center where 42 rescued bears are in residence. Dr Wong 
received his education and training in Taiwan and Montana, USA.

We also met local people who are involved in the reforestation of Borneo. 
Each day they encourage 20-100 visitors to plant individual bamboo shoots 
or culms. Each week thousands of new trees are given a new life!

And finally, our immersion in the Borneo Rainforest at Danum Valley 
provided us with an amazing opportunity to discover the numerous species of 
plants and animals, with 340 species of birds, 124 species of mammals, 72 
species of reptiles, and 56 species of amphibians. The valley is considered 
a true biodiversity hotspot, with several rare and endangered species, 
including the Bornean Orangutan, the Pygmy Elephant, the Clouded Leopard, 
and the Proboscis Monkey. The forest is also home to over 15,000 species of 
plants, including the world's tallest tropical tree, and 94% of the plant 
species in Danum Valley are from the dipterocarp genus, with many of these 
species being endemic to Borneo. Being able to learn from local guides and 
biologists who have lived their lives in this environment reinforced our 
desire to take small steps to support the amazing work of dedicated local 
people.
