HIGH ASIA HABITAT FUND

PROTECTING CRITICAL ECOSYSTEMS ON THE ROOF OF THE WORLD

The High Asia Habitat Fund’s mission is to protect High Asia’s critical ecosystems through conserving wildlife, restoring wild habitat, and empowering dependent communities toward conservation.

The Omotani Caring Foundation is pleased to become a supporter of the High Asia Habitat Fund.  We were introduced to the founder of HAHF, Behzad Larry, by Brad Josephs.  The OCF will make donations under the heading of its Goal Seven: Donor Requests [Hopes and Dreams]

Initially the OCF will fund two projects that are currently emerging with the leadership of HAHF.  One project involves efforts to limit the growth of the feral dog population in the high Himalayan regions and reduce their negative impact upon local livestock and families.   The second project will directly involve Brad Josephs as the lead facilitator and trainer in the Drass community to help everyone to understand how to reduce and/or eliminate the damage caused by bears.  A long-term goal will be to train local members of the community to become rangers and guides who understand how to protect the bears, reduce any areas of conflict and serve as rangers and guides who lead visiting guests to safely observe the bears in their natural habitat.

Plans have been made to travel directly to the Ladakh region of India to observe and learn how to provide additional meaningful support for these projects.
