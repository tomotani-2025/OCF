# STUDENT PHOTOGRAPHERS: THE ADVENTURE BEGINS

## Feed the children and their minds

## Feed the children and the families

Paul Kirui visited the Bwindi Plus School and delivered three new digital cameras and a projector.  He also provided several photography lesson books that will be used by the teachers and students.

Ian Markham with PICC will deliver two additional digital mirrorless cameras and lenses during his visit to the school.

The teachers and students will learn and practice the skills and art of photography.  Visitors from all over the world travel to photograph the natural environment, the wildlife and the people who live in Bwindi, Uganda.  With this new opportunity to learn how to become photographers, the students will be able to learn how to use visual photos and videos to tell their own stories.
