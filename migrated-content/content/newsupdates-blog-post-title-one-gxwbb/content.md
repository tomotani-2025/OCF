## Feed the children and the families

Conversations and unknown mutual friendships often lead to learning of shared values and goals.  As a result of such relationships in Bwindi, Uganda and in the United States new and positive relationships have been established.

We want to continue to introduce students to lessons and experiences that allow them to become proficient users of high-quality digital cameras and also successful storytellers and artists. Paul Kirui, Senior Advisor, and Court Whelan, Ph. D, Natural Habitat Adventures, are both expert safari guides and amazing professional photographers who are leading our efforts to educate the students and teachers in learning how to become successful photographers using high quality digital cameras.

With the support of Koen K Van Rompay [USA Advisor] we have established a new partnership initiative with Kathy West and Photography Inspiring Children in Conservation [PICC].

Kathy West, MS is a conservation photographer, primatologist and the founder and director of PICC.  Some of the awards she has received are:

2019 Kyes Award for Excellence in Outreach, American Society of Primatologists, Top 250 NANPA Photography Showcase 2020, 2021,

Semi-finalist, Nature’s Best Photography 2017 and 2020 and

Semi-finalist, Mkapa African Wildlife Photography Awards 2021

PHOTOGRAPHY INSPIRING CHILDREN IN CONSERVATION [PICC] was founded on the concept of engaging with the natural world through visual arts, focusing their work in primate habitat countries. The program goal is to build local capacity and inspire students to become conservation leaders within their communities by providing them with knowledge of primate ecology, as well as local conservation issues and solutions.  PICC program students gain skills in photography, illustration, and storytelling, providing an effective foundation upon which they may seek conservation-oriented careers. Kathy is excited about the post-pandemic future of introducing PICC’s  programs  with the children and teachers of the Bwindi school(s) and working on conservation efforts for mountain gorillas, chimpanzees and other endangered wildlife.

PICC staff will guide the Bwindi  students and teachers  into  the bamboo rainforest to learn about the wildlife, how to photograph and sketch plants and animals, and how to make scientific notes in their notebooks. Using technology and equipment permanently provided to the school, these children will continue to make photographs and drawings and share their new knowledge and passion with their communities about how to protect the mountain gorillas, other wildlife and the Bwindi Impenetrable National Forest.
