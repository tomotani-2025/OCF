# Bees for honey and chickens for eggs!

## Plants grow with sun and rain

## From seeds to vibrant plants for food!

BWINDI NYAMBISHAMBA PORTER ASSOCIATION    APRIL 16 2023

We are pleased to announce to start of a new project to support members of the porters associations near Bwindi, Uganda.  The porters who live in small villages near Bwindi make it possible for many, many visitors to successfully trek to be among the mountain gorillas in the bamboo rainforest.  With their wonderful assistance the task of trekking the trails and hiking up and down the hills and trails is made easier, possible and even enjoyable!

During the shutdown in tourism that began in 2020 the OCF donated and distributed food and soap to many of the local porters.  This new project is an effort to provide a new source of independence for the porters.

This project will be coordinated with the support of the Rafiki Memorial Wildlife Conservation Initiative.

Koen Von Rompay and  Mushamba Moses and Tweheyo Robert are willing to provide the financial oversight for this small project.   Paul Kirui will serve as an advisor for this project.

The OCF will  provide small annual grants to purchase bees and chickens. A few of the porters, such as Byamukama Milton,  have already established 35 bee hives that are producing honey.  This project will start with one porter association [Bwindi Nyambishamba  (Bujengwe)  Porters Association] and if the first project is successful, we may expand to include members of additional porter associations in the future.

The project should promote additional porters and Batwa being trained and obtaining certificates in bee keeping and chickens and poultry.

Byamukama Milton has certificates in bee keeping and chickens.

Byaruhanga Denis has a certificate in chickens/poultry.

Msuinguzi Julius is senior in bee keeping.

Niwagaba Agry has certificate in chickens.

Batwa Budara Fred is an expert in bee keeping.

Phase one of this project will focus upon the Nyamishamba [Bujengwe] Porters association.

The project plan is for 75% of net profit from sales benefit the members of the Nyamishamba [Bujengwe] porters association.  They will use this funding to sustain their new activities of bee keeping and raising chickens.  They may also use the funds to support their children attending school and for the general support of their families.

Approximately 20% of the net profit from sales saved to a fund for future purchases for all four  porter associations.  A minimum amount [less than 5%] will be allocated for local training, management and accounting costs provided by staff of the Rafiki Memorial Wildlife Conservation Initiative.

The Bwindi Nyamishamba Porters Association is located in the village of Nyamishamba, in the parish of Bujengwe, sub county of Kayonza in the District of Kanungu, Uganda.

==================================================

To date Byamukama Milton and his group have 34 bee hives. The group currently involves 7 porters and 4 Batwa in this project.

The project encourages all porter associations to include additional Batwa people in these projects.

In phase one the OCF will fund the purchase of an additional 60 bee hives.  It is hoped that these hives will produce approximately 120 liters of honey.

Each liter can be sold for approximately $6 USD [20000 UGX]

PROJECTED SALES TOTAL = $720 USD [ 2 harvests of honey each year = $1440 total]

Also, in phase one the OCF project plans to purchase and donate 100 chickens which are expected to start laying eggs within 30 days.

One dozen eggs sells for approximately 7524 UGX - $2.00 USD

PROJECTED SALES TOTAL = 100 chickens will produce approximately 80 eggs per day which will result in approximately $14 per day [$420 each month] .
