# US Funds for TPN

## BATWA FARM AT MATANDA

## Growing life

In November of 2023 the new collaboration with The Partners Nepal, Sahaya International and the Omotani Caring Foundation successfully transferred $8,500 USD to The Partners Nepal.  This collaboration now provides US citizens with an easy and secure method to support the work of TPN by making donations to a registered US 501 c 3 charity.
