# Goal Ten:  Base Camp For Veterans(Tucson, AZ)

#### Base Camp for Veterans.   BCI

BaseCamp for Veterans, Inc. ("BCI") was founded by life-long friends Deborah Plum & Theo Windish, who each have experience in both the private and public sectors, and who have spent a significant portion of their professional lives connecting people, being a part of charitable groups, and investing their time in projects that served a variety of communities.

The desire to create something sustainable that truly gives back to generations of people, combined with a palpable awareness of the noticeable decline in comprehensive veteran services, particularly ones that include families as part of the process, led Theo and Deborah to conclude that the veteran community was where they needed to focus their energy.

Our Mission: To respond to the needs of those who serve our nation and protect its values, by promoting personal and professional growth, and contributing to an effective, sustainable path towards reintegration.​

The Omotani Caring Foundation [OCF] has been pleased to provide support to BCI for 2024, 2025 and beyond.  In particular we have supported the work of the mustang trainer, Randy Helm, and his work with introducing the veterans to the unique connection available with mustangs.
