Brad Josephs and the Brown Bears of the High Himalaya mountains

The Omotani Caring Foundation is pleased to support the work of Brad Josephs and Voygr Expeditions in the first steps of establishing a conservation and tourism program that will promote the sustainability of the Himilayan Brown Bears and the lives of the local people.

The link below is the first video showing the passion of the local people for the opportunity to be a critical partner in the future lives of the Himalayan brown bears.  During the next few months additional research, planning and filming will occur to continue the development of this important initiative.

We have confirmed plans to travel to Ladakh, India and additional remote villages in the high Himalayan mountains of India in the spring of 2026.  We look forward to meeting the local people who live in the remote villages and learning how we can best support the future lives of the Himalayan brown bears and the local villagers who will protect them and introduce them to visitors from all over the world!  We anticipate continuing to donate funds to support the innovative and important work of the teams associated with the High Asia Habitat Fund.
