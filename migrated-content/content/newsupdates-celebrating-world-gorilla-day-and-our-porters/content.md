# CELEBRATING WORLD GORILLA DAY AND OUR PORTERS

## Growing life

## Distribution of flour and beans from first harvest

On September 24th we join the world in celebrating the growing families of mountain gorillas and the well being of our friends who work as porters and rangers who take care of them and the amazing rainforest they call home.
