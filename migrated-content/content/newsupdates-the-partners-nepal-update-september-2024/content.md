AN UPDATE FROM SIR EDMUND HILLARY ELDERLY CARE CENTER IN BUNG SOLUKHUMBU, NEPAL

THE PARTNERS NEPAL SEPTEMBER 2024

1. INTRODUCTION

The Partners Nepal (TPN) is pleased to provide an update on the Sir Edmund Hillary Memorial and Elderly Care Center in Mahakulung Rural Municipality-1, Solukhumbu, as of September 2024. The clinic, originally built by Sir Edmund Hillary in 1989, was severely damaged in the 2015 earthquake. In 2016, it was rebuilt with support from the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation, Germany, and Professor Wolfgang Nairz from Nepal Hilfe-Tirol. Since then, numerous donors, including longtime supporter Dr. Les Omotani, have continued to support the elderly care center in Bung.

2. PROJECT LOCATION

Bung, located in the southeast of Solukhumbu at an altitude of 1200-2400 meters, is part of the newly formed Mahakulung Municipality following the recent merger of VDCs under Nepal's new constitution. Around 90% of the population is Kulung (Rai), with the remainder being Sherpa, Brahmin, and other castes. The population is scattered across approximately 900 households, with a total of around 4,500 people.

3. ABOUT SIR EDMUND HILLARY MEMORIAL MUSUEM AND EDLERY CARE CENTER IN BUNG, SOLUKHUMBU DISTRICT

The Sir Edmund Hillary Memorial Museum and Elderly Care Centre in Bung, Solukhumbu, honors Sir Edmund Hillary's legacy. Hillary, together with Tenzing Norgay, was one of the first climbers to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953. This center acts as both a museum commemorating his achievements in the region and a facility for aged care in the local community. The center, located in the Solukhumbu district, is strongly tied to Hillary's humanitarian work and represents his long-standing commitment to improving the lives of the local community mixture of all ethnic groups through healthcare, education, and cultural preservation.

4. WHY SUPPORT TO SIR EDMUND HILLARY ELDERLY CARE CENTER?

An elderly care center in Bung, Solukhumbu, is critical to assisting the isolated region's aging population. It provides critical services such as medical care, healthy meals, and a safe living environment, ensuring that the elderly are given the attention and respect they deserve. The center develops a sense of community by allowing inhabitants to participate in social events while staying connected to their cultural heritage. This facility is an invaluable resource, addressing the issues of aging in a region recognized for its harsh topography and limited access to healthcare.

Following the inauguration, the center was formally registered with the District Development Committee, and a nine-member management committee was established.
