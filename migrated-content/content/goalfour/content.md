# Goal Four:  Technology

#### In previous years the Omotani Caring Foundation has donated individual computers and a color printer for a school for orphans.

#### The Omotani Caring Foundation has also collaborated with a US school system and a US ambassador to provide laptop computers to deserving students in a Caribbean island country.Simple technology such as solar panels and light bulbs can support education.  Many students do not have light bulbs in their homes. Individual solar panels and light bulbs allow students to complete homework and assignments when it is dark at night.

#### Provide a limited number of high quality digital mirrorless cameras and lenses, Go Pro video cameras, and digital webinars, instructional software and color print materials to support older students being able to learn and practice the basic and advanced skills and art of photography. Very few local students or adults in Uganda and other countries learn the skills necessary to become a professional photographer. Ironically visitors travel from throughout the world to photograph the natural environment and wildlife located in places such as Bwindi, Uganda.  Providing digital cameras, computer hardware and software and instructional materials and support will allow the students to learn and use visual photos and videos to tell their stories.
