# Plants grow with sun and rain

## BWINDI NYAMBISHAMBA PORTER CHICKEN AND EGG POULTRY PROJECT

## Bees for honey and chickens for eggs!

We are seeing good progress, at the Matanda farm, in the growth of the first crops!  We have great hope that this will be a positive future farm harvest for the Batwa families!
