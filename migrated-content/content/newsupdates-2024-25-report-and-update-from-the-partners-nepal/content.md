# 2024-25 Report and update from The Partners Nepal

## Batwa Farm has more progress!

## Mushamba Moses provides a quick update on work at the farm!

We have received the 2024-25 report from THE PARTNERS NEPAL from Ang Rita Sherpa.This report provides a great summary of the meaningful work being done by THE PARTNERS NEPAL.

Their work includes ongoing projects and new projects.  We are pleased to support TPN and as International Advisors to TPN we are looking forward to visiting Nepal in November and learning about current and future needs.
