RANDY HELM HORSEMANSHIP

We were able to be present during the Mustang Trainer Challenge held in Chino Valley AZ from May 30 - June 2, 2024.

The five trainer teams were amazing in their use and demonstration of “least resistance training and positive reinforcement of desired horse behaviors.”  ALL five (5) mustangs were adopted at the end of the trainer challenge.  These mustangs have a new purpose in life and will be living at wonderful forever homes.

The OCF was able to adopt RAYNE.  We originally thought that Rayne would find a purpose providing equine therapy to children and veterans.  Rayne’s journey to good health and a meaningful purpose has taken many more months that originally predicated.  As of April 2025, we continue to support her ongoing training, care and boarding.  We believe she will find a great forever home!
