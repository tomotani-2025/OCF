# Shaya Rafiki guesthouse and lodge

## Batwa Farm Project at Kihihi, Uganda

## Feed the children and their minds

We recently received from Koen Van Rompay and Mushamba Moses two very special videos of mountain gorilla families near the new Sahaya Rafiki [Wildlife] Guesthouse/Lodge.  It is great to see the new babies and a very healthy gorilla family!

We are very proud to be a partner with the Rafiki Wildlife organization and appreciative of the support we receive from Koen and Mushamba.

Rafiki Wildlife is also supporting the Bwindi-Buhoma United Reformed Poachers Initiative.

The team engages, supports and serves reformed poachers, Batwa [pygmies] women and children living near the Bwindi Impenetrable National Forest.

Every day, we and our friends and partners continue to make small and positive steps forward to support the orphan children, the Batwa families, the porters and young girls, women and families in the Bwindi/Buhoma villages.
