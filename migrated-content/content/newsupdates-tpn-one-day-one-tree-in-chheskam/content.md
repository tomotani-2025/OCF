THE PARTNERS NEPAL HAS SUCCESSFULLY CONSERVED AND RESTOREDTHE DELICATE ENVIRONMENT IN CHHESKAM

The Partners Nepal, a dedicated non-profit organization, launched the "One Day One Tree" project in 2018 to combat deforestation and promote ecological balance in Chheskam, Solukhumbu. This initiative encourages individuals and communities to plant a tree daily, aiming to restore deforested areas and support biodiversity.

The project actively involves local communities, schools, and volunteers to foster environmental sustainability and raise awareness about the importance of trees in climate change mitigation, wildlife habitat protection, and ecosystem health. Since its inception, "One Day One Tree" has successfully facilitated tree planting efforts in Solukhumbu and Langtang, promoting forest regeneration and conservation.

In June 2024, the project planted 500 Utis (Alnus Nepalensis), 650 rhododendrons, 78 ranichap, 86 kali chap, and 40 locally grown plants. This reforestation effort was made possible through funding from longtime supporter and TPN’s International Advisor, Dr. Les Omotani. We extend our deep gratitude for this generous support in conserving and restoring the fragile alpine ecosystems of Solukhumbu.
