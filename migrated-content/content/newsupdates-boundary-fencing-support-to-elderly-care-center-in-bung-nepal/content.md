# Boundary Fencing Support to Elderly Care Center in Bung, Nepal

## Batwa Farm at Matanda update May 4 2025

## Celebrating 100th Anniversary of the Tucson Rodeo

The Omotani Caring Foundation is pleased to provide an initial small grant [20% of the project costs] in support of the boundary fencing requested by the the management committee for the center and the seniors in the community.  It is our hope that additional donors will provide the remaining funds necessary to build the desired fencing.

The OCF will also continue to provide future funding for supplies, equipment and other necessary medical items for the Elderly Care Center.
