Mustangs [4] from the Salt River Flats in Arizona were transported to the White Stallion Ranch.  The OCF is pleased to support BCI  Base Camp for Veterans and specifically the amazing work of the lead mustang trainer -Randy Helm.  This class also include several spouses and children.  The veterans report throughout the week many specific experiences that help them to make future choices and decisions to improve their successful transition to civilian life and positive relationships.   \n\n \n\nThe entire BCI team provides and supports a wide variety of equine related therapy sessions and activities for everyone involved in the week-long program.  Previous participants from Class 0 through 8 were also invited to evening celebrations to strengthen the bonds of the BCI family.  Michael True and the entire True family and the White Stallion Ranch family generously provide an amazing environment for everyone to enjoy!  We look forward to watching and supporting Class 9 veterans as they participate in reunion events held each month throughout 2025.\n\n \n\nCLASS 9 is really the 10th class for BCI.  This is a great time to celebrate the vision, dedication and successful dreams and actions of founders Deborah Plum and Theo Windish.\n\n \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BaseCampforVeteransInc/\n\n \n\nhttps://www.bcampinc.com/about",

      "content": "Bwindi Plus Girls Project \n\n \n\nThe Girls Project is being implemented by Elizabeth as the Principal of the Bwindi Plus Orphanage School.  In Bwindi, a variety of social and economic conditions exist that make it challenging for young girls to attend and remain in school on a regular basis.\n\n \n\nThe project’s aim objective is to empower girls in schools through hands on training and free supply of menstrual health products so its open to every girl who is 8 years of age and older. The girls usually have 30 minutes for hands training and practice in making pads, uniforms, sweaters.   The girls learn skills and also benefit from the finished products.\n\n \n\nDiscussions are occurring with other schools to allow some of the girls join us for 30 min to get training and practice in the skills.\n\n \n\nElizabeth’s  dream is to make it a bigger project to give opportunities to more girls in the village.  She remembers her own personal challenges as a young girl trying to get a great education.  Her life is dedicated to helping orphans and especially young girls receive a quality education and to live a great life!\n\n \n\nWith the latest donation from OCF  an additional 200 girls have been provided with sanitary pads. The project places  4 pieces in each pack.  These pads are given out free of charge to encourage the girls stay in school and appreciate who they are as young women.   With this project we continue our support of projects focused upon education, sustainable food sources and health initiatives for children.\n\n \n\nElizabeth identifies the following goals and successes for the project:\n\n \n\n1.Reduces School Dropouts: Provides girls with necessary resources, enabling them to attend school comfortably during menstruation.\n\n \n\n2. Promotes Menstrual Health: Encourages proper hygiene, reducing risks of reproductive infections.\n\n \n\n3. Environmental Benefits: Reusable pads minimize disposable pad waste, protecting the environment.\n\n \n\n4. Cost-Effective: Long-term savings for families, as reusable pads last up to 2-3 years.\n\n \n\n5. Empowers Girls: Boosts confidence, self-esteem, and participation in education.\n\n \n\n6. Breaks Menstrual Taboos: Fosters open discussions, normalizing menstruation.\n\n \n\n7. Improves Health Education: Integrates reproductive health awareness.\n\n \n\nN.B: we have so far supplied to the following schools\n\n1. Bwindi plus girls 130\n\n2. Buhoma community primary 60 girls\n\n3. St Mathew primary 36 girls\n\n4. Bwindi junior primary 70 girls",

      "content": "AN UPDATE FROM SIR EDMUND HILLARY ELDERLY CARE CENTER IN BUNG SOLUKHUMBU, NEPAL\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n      \n  \n\n  THE PARTNERS NEPAL \nSEPTEMBER 2024\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Partners Nepal (TPN) is pleased to provide an update on the Sir Edmund Hillary Memorial and Elderly Care Center in Mahakulung Rural Municipality-1, Solukhumbu, as of September 2024. The clinic, originally built by Sir Edmund Hillary in 1989, was severely damaged in the 2015 earthquake. In 2016, it was rebuilt with support from the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation, Germany, and Professor Wolfgang Nairz from Nepal Hilfe-Tirol. Since then, numerous donors, including longtime supporter Dr. Les Omotani, have continued to support the elderly care center in Bung.\n\n2. PROJECT LOCATION\n\nBung, located in the southeast of Solukhumbu at an altitude of 1200-2400 meters, is part of the newly formed Mahakulung Municipality following the recent merger of VDCs under Nepal's new constitution. Around 90% of the population is Kulung (Rai), with the remainder being Sherpa, Brahmin, and other castes. The population is scattered across approximately 900 households, with a total of around 4,500 people.\n\n3. ABOUT SIR EDMUND HILLARY MEMORIAL MUSUEM AND EDLERY CARE CENTER IN BUNG, SOLUKHUMBU DISTRICT\n\nThe Sir Edmund Hillary Memorial Museum and Elderly Care Centre in Bung, Solukhumbu, honors Sir Edmund Hillary's legacy. Hillary, together with Tenzing Norgay, was one of the first climbers to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953. This center acts as both a museum commemorating his achievements in the region and a facility for aged care in the local community. The center, located in the Solukhumbu district, is strongly tied to Hillary's humanitarian work and represents his long-standing commitment to improving the lives of the local community mixture of all ethnic groups through healthcare, education, and cultural preservation.\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n      \n  \n\n  4. WHY SUPPORT TO SIR EDMUND HILLARY ELDERLY CARE CENTER?\n\nAn elderly care center in Bung, Solukhumbu, is critical to assisting the isolated region's aging population. It provides critical services such as medical care, healthy meals, and a safe living environment, ensuring that the elderly are given the attention and respect they deserve. The center develops a sense of community by allowing inhabitants to participate in social events while staying connected to their cultural heritage. This facility is an invaluable resource, addressing the issues of aging in a region recognized for its harsh topography and limited access to healthcare.\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n      \n  \n\n  5. THE BENEFITS OF SIR EDMUND HILLARY ELDERLY CARE CENTER\n\nAn elderly care initiative in Bung, Solukhumbu, provides major benefits to the local population.\n\n1. Improved Quality of Life: The project offers necessary care and support to the elderly, promoting dignity and comfort. This includes access to medical treatment, healthy eating, and social activities.\n\n2. Community Support: The care center serves as a support structure for families, reducing the pressure of caregiving and allowing younger members to focus on jobs and school while their seniors are well-cared for.\n\n3. Preservation of Culture: The elderly preserve local traditions and expertise. By assisting them, the project contributes to the preservation of the region's cultural legacy, ensuring that valuable customs and stories are passed down through future generations.\n\n4. Health and Well-being: Regular health check-ups and access to medical treatment can lower the likelihood of untreated illnesses among the elderly, leading to a healthier and more resilient community.\n\n5. Economic Stability: Providing care for the elderly in the community minimizes the need for families to seek costlier alternatives, adding to the area's economic stability.\n\n6. Social Cohesion: The project promotes a sense of belonging and respect for the elderly, increasing community links and intergenerational linkages.\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n      \n  \n\n  6. RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM SIR EDMUND HILLARY STIFTUNG DEUSTCHLAND AND NEPAL HILFE-TIROL\n\nThe financial request submitted by The Partners Nepal in October 2015 was accepted by Sir Edmund Hillary Stiftung Deutschland. Wolfgang from Nepal Hilfe Tirol, Austria, then provided matching support. The clinic reconstruction project, jointly undertaken by TPN and Hill Development Conservation Group (HDCG), was completed in October 2017 with financial assistance from both organizations. The Sir Edmund Hillary Memorial Museum and Elder Care Centre was inaugurated on October 16, 2017, under the leadership of Professor Wolfgang Nairz, chairman of Nepal Hilfe Tirol. Following the inauguration, the center was formally registered with the District Development Committee, and a nine-member management committee was established.\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n      \n  \n\n  \n      \n  \n\n  7. KEY CONTRIBUTIONS OF PARTNERS NEPAL TO THE ELDERLY CARE PROJECT\n\nThe Partners Nepal, dedicated to improving lives in rural Nepal, is a key partner in the Elderly Care Project in Bung, Solukhumbu. This initiative supports vulnerable populations in underdeveloped areas where healthcare and social services are limited. Since 2016, TPN has been able to continue its support for the senior care center in Bung thanks to generous global contributions, particularly from long-time supporters Dr. Les and Barbara Omotani. The Partners Nepal continues to assist the elderly project in various ways. The Partners Nepal provides essential healthcare services to the elderly in Bung, including routine check-ups, medication, and treatment for chronic ailments, in an area with limited medical facilities. They also serve nutritious meals and vitamins, reducing malnutrition and improving overall well-being.\n\nTPN has enhanced the care center’s infrastructure, offering safe living quarters, medical facilities, and social spaces for the elderly. By involving the local community, TPN fosters a sense of ownership and ensures the project is sustainable and meets the specific needs of the elderly.\n\nTo secure the center’s long-term viability, TPN aims to build a sustainable model using local resources and community-based support networks. Additionally, the initiative helps preserve the Solukhumbu region’s unique cultural heritage by supporting the elderly in their role as custodians of local traditions.\n\nTPN’s efforts greatly enhance the quality of life for the elderly in Bung, allowing them to age with dignity, respect, and access to vital services.\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n      \n  \n\n  \n      \n  \n\n  \n      \n  \n\n  8. SUPPORT RECEIVED FROM DR. OMOTANI\n\nSince 2023, The Partners Nepal has received support from Dr. Les Omotani, a longtime mentor and International Advisor to TPN. Dr. Omotani has shown great interest in supporting the elderly care center and provided financial assistance. With his generous contribution, TPN has supplied steel closets for securing belongings, as well as extra bed sheets, clothes, pillows, and replaced all beds, blankets, pillow covers and flat Television for them to watch..\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n      \n  \n\n  \n      \n  \n\n  9. APPRECIATION\n\nThe Partners Nepal and the community of Bung, Solukhumbu, deeply appreciate the continued support from Dr. Les Omotani. The elderly citizens, local representatives, and community members have expressed their desire to welcome Dr. Omotani and his family to the elderly care center in the near future.\n\nResidents of Bung and neighboring villages—Cheskam, Gudel, Sotang, and Pawai—also extend their heartfelt gratitude for his generous financial support to the Sir Edmund Hillary Memorial Museum and Elder Care Centre. The management committee and the elderly have thanked Dr. Omotani for providing wooden closets and new bedding, including beds, sheets, pillows, and pillow covers.\n\n10.

This initiative encourages individuals and communities to plant a tree daily, aiming to restore deforested areas and support biodiversity. \n\nThe project actively involves local communities, schools, and volunteers to foster environmental sustainability and raise awareness about the importance of trees in climate change mitigation, wildlife habitat protection, and ecosystem health. Since its inception, \"One Day One Tree\" has successfully facilitated tree planting efforts in Solukhumbu and Langtang, promoting forest regeneration and conservation.\n\nIn June 2024, the project planted 500 Utis (Alnus Nepalensis), 650 rhododendrons, 78 ranichap, 86 kali chap, and 40 locally grown plants. This reforestation effort was made possible through funding from longtime supporter and TPN’s International Advisor, Dr. Les Omotani.

The farm is a great example of a project that provides the Batwa families with a local and sustainable source of food for their future!",

We were introduced to the founder of HAHF, Behzad Larry, by Brad Josephs.  The OCF will make donations under the heading of its Goal Seven: Donor Requests [Hopes and Dreams] \n\n \n\nInitially the OCF will fund two projects that are currently emerging with the leadership of HAHF.  One project involves efforts to limit the growth of the feral dog population in the high Himalayan regions and reduce their negative impact upon local livestock and families.   The second project will directly involve Brad Josephs as the lead facilitator and trainer in the Drass community to help everyone to understand how to reduce and/or eliminate the damage caused by bears.  A long-term goal will be to train local members of the community to become rangers and guides who understand how to protect the bears, reduce any areas of conflict and serve as rangers and guides who lead visiting guests to safely observe the bears in their natural habitat.\n\n \n\nPlans have been made to travel directly to the Ladakh region of India to observe and learn how to provide additional meaningful support for these projects.\n\n \n\n \n\nhttps://highasiafund.org\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n         Snow leopard photo by Behzad Larry HAHAF",

The Omotani Caring Foundation continues to provide support for the needs of the Elderly Care Center and Clinic located in Bung village.  Last week The Partners Nepal provided the center and clinic with new beds, pillow sheets, blankets and other supplies.  The elderly citizens of Bung deserve and appreciate the ongoing support being provided for them.\n\nhttps://thepartnersnepal.org/sir-edmund-hillary-memorial-museum/\n\nApril 3, 2024  Thanks to the financial assistance provided by Drs. Les and Barbara Omotani: The Omotani Caring Foundation, we have utilized the funds to procure therapy equipment for the Elderly Care Centre.

Hillary, together with Tenzing Norgay, was one of the first climbers to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953. This center acts as both a museum commemorating his achievements in the region and a facility for aged care in the local community. The center, located in the Solukhumbu district, is strongly tied to Hillary's humanitarian work and represents his long-standing commitment to improving the lives of the local community mixture of all ethnic groups through healthcare, education, and cultural preservation.\n\n \n\nAn elderly care center in Bung, Solukhumbu, is critical to assisting the isolated region's aging population. It provides critical services such as medical care, healthy meals, and a safe living environment, ensuring that the elderly are given the attention and respect they deserve. The center develops a sense of community by allowing inhabitants to participate in social events while staying connected to their cultural heritage. This facility is an invaluable resource, addressing the issues of aging in a region recognized for its harsh topography and limited access to healthcare.\n\n \n\nAn elderly care initiative in Bung, Solukhumbu, provides major benefits to the local population.\n\n1. Improved Quality of Life: The project offers necessary care and support to the elderly, promoting dignity and comfort. This includes access to medical treatment, healthy eating, and social activities.\n\n2. Community Support: The care center serves as a support structure for families, reducing the pressure of caregiving and allowing younger members to focus on jobs and school while their seniors are well-cared for.\n\n3. Preservation of Culture: The elderly preserve local traditions and expertise. By assisting them, the project contributes to the preservation of the region's cultural legacy, ensuring that valuable customs and stories are passed down through future generations.\n\n4. Health and Well-being: Regular health check-ups and access to medical treatment can lower the likelihood of untreated illnesses among the elderly, leading to a healthier and more resilient community.\n\n5. Economic Stability: Providing care for the elderly in the community minimizes the need for families to seek costlier alternatives, adding to the area's economic stability.\n\n6. Social Cohesion: The project promotes a sense of belonging and respect for the elderly, increasing community links and intergenerational linkages.\n\n \n\nThe Partners Nepal, an organization dedicated to improving the lives of people in Nepal's rural regions, is a key partner in the Elderly Care Project in Bung, Solukhumbu. This effort is part of their larger aim to help vulnerable populations, particularly in underdeveloped places like Solukhumbu, where healthcare and social services are scarce.\n\nKey Contributions of Partners Nepal to the Elderly Care Project:\n\n \n\nThe Partners Nepal was able to continue supporting this senior care center in Bung since 2016 because of generous contributions from throughout the world, particularly from recognized long-time supporters like Dr. Les and Barbara Omotani and The Omotani Caring Foundation. The Partners Nepal continues to assist the elderly project in the following ways:\n\n \n\n1. The Partners Nepal provides healthcare services to the elderly in Bung, such as routine check-ups, medication, and treatment for chronic ailments. This aid is crucial in an area where medical facilities are few.\n\n2. The organization serves healthy meals and vitamins to the elderly, reducing malnutrition and improving overall health and well-being.\n\n3. The Partners Nepal has assisted in improving the infrastructure of the care center to better serve the senior population. This includes safe and comfortable living quarters, medical facilities, and places to socialize.\n\n4. The Partners Nepal involves local communities in the project, instilling a sense of ownership and responsibility in individuals. This cooperation helps to ensure the project's sustainability and that the services are tailored to the specific needs of the local elder population.\n\n5. To secure the care center's long-term viability, the organization intends to build a sustainable model by integrating local resources and cultivating community-based support networks.\n\n6. The care initiative protects and promotes the Solukhumbu region's unique cultural heritage. The elderly, with their wide knowledge of local traditions, play a critical role in preserving the community's cultural identity, and Partners Nepal supports their efforts.\n\n \n\nThe Partners Nepal's efforts significantly improve the quality of life for the elderly in Bung, allowing them to age with dignity, respect, and access to critical services.",

These mustangs have a new purpose in life and will be living at wonderful forever homes.  \n\n \n\nThe OCF was able to adopt RAYNE.  We originally thought that Rayne would find a purpose providing equine therapy to children and veterans.  Rayne’s journey to good health and a meaningful purpose has taken many more months that originally predicated.  As of April 2025, we continue to support her ongoing training, care and boarding.  We believe she will find a great forever home!",

Generous donors have provided the funds for the construction of the planned and needed farmhouse.  Everyone is grateful for the support of caring people!\n\n During the planting and harvest activities the Batwa families must travel from their homes to the farm.  The new farmhouse will allow some members to remain at the farm.  The new facility will also provide storage space for farming equipment, supplies and even storage of some harvested crops.\n\n Every month brings new proof that Batwa farm is a growing success.

      "content": "The Partners Nepal\n\nUpdate April 3, 2024 by Ang Rita Sherpa\n\n \n\n1.         ONE DAY ONE TREE IN SAGARMATHA NATIONAL PARK AND BUFFER ZONE\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2016, The Partners Nepal initiated the \"Community-based Alpine Conservation and Restoration Project\" in Pangboche, with initial funding from Sir Edmund Hillary Stiftung Deutschland in Germany. The primary aim of this project was to preserve and rehabilitate the delicate alpine ecosystems of Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone in the Mount Everest region. The area's degradation has occurred due to excessive grazing, the excessive harvesting of alpine shrubs for fuelwood, and inadequate conservation practices. Additionally, global warming and climate change have had a particularly negative impact on the Khumbu region, which includes Mt. Everest. Similarly, to alleviate the consequences of climate change, a key strategy for adapting to climate change is to maximize tree planting in various locations. \n\n \n\nThe Partners Nepal understands the critical importance. Forests are essential for the maintenance of life on our planet. Forests provide crucial advantages such as unpolluted air, diverse ecosystems, and sources of income for millions of people around the globe. Under the guidance of Dr. Les Omotani, we effectively proceeded with the cultivation of indigenous trees in Khunde village, situated at an elevation of 3840m. Tree planting offers a multitude of benefits to both the environment and the local community. The program fosters cooperation among Sherpa communities, tourists, the government, benefactors [such as the Omotani Caring Foundation], and organizations to safeguard alpine ecosystems. Community members can contribute to forest preservation by participating in the exchange of information.\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n   \n\n2.          IN CHESKAM VILLAGE, THE PARTNERS NEPAL SUPPORTS COMMUNITY PONDS AS CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION\n\n \n\nIn 2023, The Partners Nepal constructed a community pond in Chheskam, Mahakulung Rural Municipality-1, Solukhumbu, to mitigate the effects of climate change. Climate adaptation requires the utilization of a communal pond. As global communities work towards sustainable solutions for climate change, initiatives such as these are vital milestones towards a more resilient future. This community pond is crucial to adapting to climate change and enhancing environmental resilience. By establishing and upkeeping these miniature aquatic habitats, we actively contribute to reducing global warming, preserving ecosystems, and promoting community involvement in conservation endeavors. Conserving these areas enhances, broadens, and stabilizes the ecological reactions to climate change. Climate change is responsible for droughts and storms, which require the implementation of water management strategies. Effective management of rainwater through neighborhood ponds can help mitigate droughts. Let us persist in advocating for creative solutions and environmentally friendly practices to benefit our planet and future generations.\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n   \n\n \n\n3.          SIR EDMUND HILLARY MEMORIAL AND ELDERLY CARE CENTER IN BUNG\n\n \n\nIn 2016, we received a request from the residents of Bung to assist in conserving and revitalizing a building damaged by the earthquake in 2015. In 1989, Sir Edmund Hillary constructed a clinic in this village to offer healthcare services to the local community, who previously had to travel a considerable distance to reach either Phaplu Hospital or Khunde Hospital, also established by Sir Edmund Hillary. Thanks to financial assistance from the Sir Edmund Hillary Stiftung Deutschland, The Partners Nepal has successfully reconstructed the clinic that was devastated by the earthquake in 2015. Additionally, they have provided extensive aid in the form of shelters for elderly citizens who lack caretakers.\n\nThanks to the financial assistance provided by Drs. Les and Barbara Omotani: The Omotani Caring Foundation, we have utilized the funds to procure therapy equipment for the Elderly Care Centre. Individuals utilize the Nuga Best Massage Bed for therapeutic purposes and relaxation. It aids in maintaining proper spinal alignment, promotes muscle relaxation, and facilitates blood purification. Korean Jade Spine Heating Mats and massage beds are essential as acupressure benefits one's well-being. Massage therapy has the potential to alleviate stress, anxiety, and tension, relax muscles, reduce chronic pain, and enhance blood circulation. As mentioned earlier, providing seniors with the Nuga Best Massage Bed or Therapy will facilitate their acquisition of the advantages.",

Eight (8) Batwa families each received the first distribution of 20 KGs of flour/posho and 3 KGs of beans.\n\n \n\nThis is a time to celebrate the first harvest and distribution from the Batwa farm at Matanda.

      "content": "It is September and after the successful harvesting of the FIRST crop at the new Batwa Farm at Matanda we are pleased to know that the planting of the SECOND farm crop is being completed.  In Uganda we are all very happy that there is the opportunity to plant and harvest two crops each year.  Our hope and expectation is that the second harvest will be even greater in quantity, variety of foods [corn, cassava, beans, etc] and overall yield than the first planting.  \n\n \n\nThe farm work is being done by hand and is indeed hard labor.  The OCF has supported the funding for the planting needs of the second crop.  The Batwa families must travel to the farm, have seeds to plant, preparation of the land by tractor and hand weeding, continue to be supported to learn how to plant and weed and harvest the plants and we also support a farm caretaker to watch over the farm’s growing plants.  It is the hope of everyone that in the future the Batwa Farm at Matanda will be self-sustaining for the costs associated with each new season.\n\nOur next phases of this farm project will include the construction of a storage and housing building for the Batwa when they are working on the farm and also the purchase of additional land for farming.",

The porters who live in small villages near Bwindi make it possible for many, many visitors to successfully trek to be among the mountain gorillas in the bamboo rainforest.  With their wonderful assistance the task of trekking the trails and hiking up and down the hills and trails is made easier, possible and even enjoyable!\n\n \n\nDuring the shutdown in tourism that began in 2020 the OCF donated and distributed food and soap to many of the local porters.  This new project is an effort to provide a new source of independence for the porters.\n\n \n\nThis project will be coordinated with the support of the Rafiki Memorial Wildlife Conservation Initiative.\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://rafikiwildlife.org/nyambishamba-porters/\n\n \n\nhttp://rafikiwildlife.org/\n\n \n\nKoen Von Rompay and  Mushamba Moses and Tweheyo Robert are willing to provide the financial oversight for this small project.   Paul Kirui will serve as an advisor for this project.\n\n \n\nThe OCF will  provide small annual grants to purchase bees and chickens. A few of the porters, such as Byamukama Milton,  have already established 35 bee hives that are producing honey.  This project will start with one porter association [Bwindi Nyambishamba  (Bujengwe)  Porters Association] and if the first project is successful, we may expand to include members of additional porter associations in the future.  \n\n \n\nThe project should promote additional porters and Batwa being trained and obtaining certificates in bee keeping and chickens and poultry.\n\n \n\nByamukama Milton has certificates in bee keeping and chickens.\n\nByaruhanga Denis has a certificate in chickens/poultry.\n\nMsuinguzi Julius is senior in bee keeping.\n\nNiwagaba Agry has certificate in chickens.\n\n \n\nBatwa Budara Fred is an expert in bee keeping.\n\n \n\nPhase one of this project will focus upon the Nyamishamba [Bujengwe] Porters association.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe project plan is for 75% of net profit from sales benefit the members of the Nyamishamba [Bujengwe] porters association.  They will use this funding to sustain their new activities of bee keeping and raising chickens.  They may also use the funds to support their children attending school and for the general support of their families.\n\nApproximately 20% of the net profit from sales saved to a fund for future purchases for all four  porter associations.  A minimum amount [less than 5%] will be allocated for local training, management and accounting costs provided by staff of the Rafiki Memorial Wildlife Conservation Initiative.\n\n \n\nThe Bwindi Nyamishamba Porters Association is located in the village of Nyamishamba, in the parish of Bujengwe, sub county of Kayonza in the District of Kanungu, Uganda.\n\n \n\nhttp://rafikiwildlife.org/nyambishamba-porters/\n\n \n\n \n\n1.

The group currently involves 7 porters and 4 Batwa in this project. \n\n \n\nThe project encourages all porter associations to include additional Batwa people in these projects.\n\n \n\n In phase one the OCF will fund the purchase of an additional 60 bee hives.  It is hoped that these hives will produce approximately 120 liters of honey.\n\nEach liter can be sold for approximately $6 USD [20000 UGX] \n\n \n\nPROJECTED SALES TOTAL = $720 USD [ 2 harvests of honey each year = $1440 total]\n\n \n\n Also, in phase one the OCF project plans to purchase and donate 100 chickens which are expected to start laying eggs within 30 days.  \n\n \n\nOne dozen eggs sells for approximately 7524 UGX - $2.00 USD\n\n \n\nPROJECTED SALES TOTAL = 100 chickens will produce approximately 80 eggs per day which will result in approximately $14 per day [$420 each month] .\n\n \n\nhttp://rafikiwildlife.org/nyambishamba-porters/\n\n \n\n \n\nProject implementation plan:\n\n \n\nApril/May 2023    PHASE ONE\n\n \n\n100 chickens for Nyamishamba Bwindi Porters association.

To date the new farm will now consist of 12 acres of productive land.  This farmer is very supportive of the new farm project and is willing to provide his personal support and assistance to help make the Batwa farm project a success.\n\n \n\nhttp://rafikiwildlife.org/batwa-farm/\n\n \n\nWe hope there we can avoid the need to purchase, donate and distribute food to the families of Bwindi in the future.

The farming will be in phases, the first phase will be land preparation followed by clearing and planting seedlings of different types of crops. \n\nPreparation of land is the first step, as it’s a new farmland containing strong grass, it will require the need of a digging tractor that has to dig deep underground for a very good farm and suitable growth of crops.\n\nLand clearing will involve using hand hoes and manual labor to clear and remove some particles that are hardly seen by the digging tractor. It will also involve leveling and mapping different parts specifically for a certain type of crop\n\nAfter clearing and making partials, planting of seeds and stems will start, for the first phase of crops will include maize, beans, cassava and sweet potatoes as we continue learning the fertility and best crops for the farm \n\nProject coordinated by Rafiki Memorial Wildlife Conservation Initiative\n\nMushamba Moses and Tweheyo Robert and Koen Van Rompay [Sahaya International]\n\nSponsored by the OMOTANI CARING FOUNDATION\n\n                        OMOTANICARINGFOUNDATION.COM",

      "content": "Throughout the world we get to meet individuals who are making a significant difference in sustaining the endangered wildlife in our rainforests, oceans and remote islands.  Our travels to the Borneo rainforest, in October of 2022,   were focused upon finding orangutans in their natural habitat.   What we discovered was many local people engaged in small but important efforts to protect and sustain several endangered species.  We also continued to find amazing efforts to provide all children with a quality education.\n\n \n\nWe were impressed with the efforts of the Turtle Nest Adoption program at Sabah Parks.  \n\nhttps://www.sabahparks.org.my/turtle-islands-park/turtle-conservation\n\n \n\nWe also were happy to meet Dr. Wong Siew Te at his Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Center where 42 rescued bears are in residence.  Dr Wong received his education and training in Taiwan and Montana, USA.    https://www.bsbcc.org.my/index.html\n\n \n\nWe also met local people who are involved in the reforestation of Borneo.  Each day they encourage 20-100 visitors to plant individual bamboo shoots or culms.  Each week thousands of new trees are given a new life!\n\n \n\nAnd finally, our immersion in the Borneo Rainforest at Danum Valley provided us with an amazing opportunity to discover the numerous species of plants and animals, with 340 species of birds, 124 species of mammals, 72 species of reptiles, and 56 species of amphibians. The valley is considered a true biodiversity hotspot, with several rare and endangered species, including the Bornean Orangutan, the Pygmy Elephant, the Clouded Leopard, and the Proboscis Monkey. The forest is also home to over 15,000 species of plants, including the world's tallest tropical tree, and 94% of the plant species in Danum Valley are from the dipterocarp genus, with many of these species being endemic to Borneo.   Being able to learn from local guides and biologists who have lived their lives in this environment reinforced our desire to take small steps to support the amazing work of dedicated local people.",

      "content": "We have completed the purchase of approximately 10 acres of farm land near Kihihi, Uganda.\n\nFour Batwa settlements will be involved with the farming activities of this farm.  Tweheyo Robert of the Bwindi Batwa Farm Project  will provide leadership and training for the new farm project near Kihihi.\n\nDuring the pandemic the Omotani Caring Foundation purchased, donated and distributed food supplies to the students and teachers at the Bwindi Plus Orphanage School, members of the local porters associations and also families in nearby Batwa settlements.  Initially it was hoped that this food scarcity would only last a few months.  In reality the need lasted several years and there continue to be challenges in 2022 and beyond.\n\nDiscussions with members of four Batwa settlements led to a shared agreement that it would be desirable to purchase a productive 10-acre farm and engage members of each community in the farming activities of the farm.  The ability to grow and harvest two crops every year will help to create an improved food security and sustainable source of food for the future.  Each settlement and the Bwindi Plus Orphanage School will benefit from the harvesting of the farm’s crops.\n\n The purchase of this farm land has been completed with the support and continued partnership with the Rafiki Wildlife Conservation Initiative and the Sahaya International Foundation.   The positive collaboration that continues to exist and grow to support everyone in the Bwindi-Buhoma villages is yielding very positive results.\n\n \n\n The farm land and the farming will involve different settlement areas\n of the Batwa that includes:\n\n 1.       KIBIRANGWE SETTLEMENT\n  The settlement will be presented by the following Batwa leaders and elders\n •         Kanyamugara Geoffrey-  Leader of the settlement\n •         Nyakwezi Robinah—Settlement elder\n •         Moreen and Joel -- Batwa youth\n \n 2.       NYABISIIKA SETLLEMENT\n  The following Batwa leaders and elders will represent the settlement\n •         Nyamishana Norah – Leader of the settlement\n •         George Zankaro – Settlement elder\n •         Kahingano George—Elder\n \n 3.       MUKONGORO SETTLEMENT\n  Representatives will be\n •         Bukyebe Geoffrey—Leader of settlement\n •         Madawa Jackson—Youth\n •         Barekwe Flora – Elder\n \n 4.       KAREHE SETTLEMENT\n  The representatives will be\n •         Mukombe and Jackson – Settlement leaders\n •         Nyinaburo Ruth – Youth \n\n \nThe Batwa Farm Project at Kihihi is located at Kanyanaburimano  Kibimbiri,  Kihihi, approximately 500 meters from the main road going to Kasese.  The farm land is approximately 10 acres and has been producing high value productive crops.\n\nThe new farm project will be modeled after the successful activities of the existing Bwindi Batwa Farm project.\n\nhttp://rafikiwildlife.org/bwindi-batwa-farm/",

Some of the awards she has received are:\n\n2019 Kyes Award for Excellence in Outreach, American Society of Primatologists, Top 250 NANPA Photography Showcase 2020, 2021,\n\nSemi-finalist, Nature’s Best Photography 2017 and 2020 and\n\nSemi-finalist, Mkapa African Wildlife Photography Awards 2021\n\n \n\nPHOTOGRAPHY INSPIRING CHILDREN IN CONSERVATION [PICC] was founded on the concept of engaging with the natural world through visual arts, focusing their work in primate habitat countries. The program goal is to build local capacity and inspire students to become conservation leaders within their communities by providing them with knowledge of primate ecology, as well as local conservation issues and solutions.  PICC program students gain skills in photography, illustration, and storytelling, providing an effective foundation upon which they may seek conservation-oriented careers. Kathy is excited about the post-pandemic future of introducing PICC’s  programs  with the children and teachers of the Bwindi school(s) and working on conservation efforts for mountain gorillas, chimpanzees and other endangered wildlife.\n\nPICC staff will guide the Bwindi  students and teachers  into  the bamboo rainforest to learn about the wildlife, how to photograph and sketch plants and animals, and how to make scientific notes in their notebooks. Using technology and equipment permanently provided to the school, these children will continue to make photographs and drawings and share their new knowledge and passion with their communities about how to protect the mountain gorillas, other wildlife and the Bwindi Impenetrable National Forest.\n\nFor questions, contact Kathy at\nPICC.director@gmail.com\n\nPhotography Inspiring Children in Conservation (501(c)(3)): (85-0519766):  PICCmadagascar.org\n\nRead about some of PICC’s projects in Madagascar: https://piccmadagascar.org/picc/projects \n\nConservation Stories: \nkathyweststudios.com/conservation-and-natural-history-stories/",
