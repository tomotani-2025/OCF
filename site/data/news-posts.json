In Bwindi, a variety of social and economic conditions exist that make it challenging for young girls to attend and remain in school on a regular basis.\n\n \n\nThe project’s aim objective is to empower girls in schools through hands on training and free supply of menstrual health products so its open to every girl who is 8 years of age and older. The girls usually have 30 minutes for hands training and practice in making pads, uniforms, sweaters.   The girls learn skills and also benefit from the finished products.\n\n \n\nDiscussions are occurring with other schools to allow some of the girls join us for 30 min to get training and practice in the skills.\n\n \n\nElizabeth’s  dream is to make it a bigger project to give opportunities to more girls in the village.  She remembers her own personal challenges as a young girl trying to get a great education.  Her life is dedicated to helping orphans and especially young girls receive a quality education and to live a great life!\n\n \n\nWith the latest donation from OCF  an additional 200 girls have been provided with sanitary pads. The project places  4 pieces in each pack.  These pads are given out free of charge to encourage the girls stay in school and appreciate who they are as young women.   With this project we continue our support of projects focused upon education, sustainable food sources and health initiatives for children.\n\n \n\nElizabeth identifies the following goals and successes for the project:\n\n \n\n1.Reduces School Dropouts: Provides girls with necessary resources, enabling them to attend school comfortably during menstruation.\n\n \n\n2. Promotes Menstrual Health: Encourages proper hygiene, reducing risks of reproductive infections.\n\n \n\n3. Environmental Benefits: Reusable pads minimize disposable pad waste, protecting the environment.\n\n \n\n4. Cost-Effective: Long-term savings for families, as reusable pads last up to 2-3 years.\n\n \n\n5. Empowers Girls: Boosts confidence, self-esteem, and participation in education.\n\n \n\n6. Breaks Menstrual Taboos: Fosters open discussions, normalizing menstruation.\n\n \n\n7. Improves Health Education: Integrates reproductive health awareness.\n\n \n\nN.B: we have so far supplied to the following schools\n\n1. Bwindi plus girls 130\n\n2.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Partners Nepal (TPN) is pleased to provide an update on the Sir Edmund Hillary Memorial and Elderly Care Center in Mahakulung Rural Municipality-1, Solukhumbu, as of September 2024. The clinic, originally built by Sir Edmund Hillary in 1989, was severely damaged in the 2015 earthquake. In 2016, it was rebuilt with support from the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation, Germany, and Professor Wolfgang Nairz from Nepal Hilfe-Tirol. Since then, numerous donors, including longtime supporter Dr. Les Omotani, have continued to support the elderly care center in Bung.\n\n2. PROJECT LOCATION\n\nBung, located in the southeast of Solukhumbu at an altitude of 1200-2400 meters, is part of the newly formed Mahakulung Municipality following the recent merger of VDCs under Nepal's new constitution. Around 90% of the population is Kulung (Rai), with the remainder being Sherpa, Brahmin, and other castes. The population is scattered across approximately 900 households, with a total of around 4,500 people.\n\n3.

This initiative encourages individuals and communities to plant a tree daily, aiming to restore deforested areas and support biodiversity. \n\nThe project actively involves local communities, schools, and volunteers to foster environmental sustainability and raise awareness about the importance of trees in climate change mitigation, wildlife habitat protection, and ecosystem health. Since its inception, \"One Day One Tree\" has successfully facilitated tree planting efforts in Solukhumbu and Langtang, promoting forest regeneration and conservation.\n\nIn June 2024, the project planted 500 Utis (Alnus Nepalensis), 650 rhododendrons, 78 ranichap, 86 kali chap, and 40 locally grown plants. This reforestation effort was made possible through funding from longtime supporter and TPN’s International Advisor, Dr. Les Omotani.

      "content": "The Partners Nepal\n\nUpdate April 3, 2024 by Ang Rita Sherpa\n\n \n\n1.         ONE DAY ONE TREE IN SAGARMATHA NATIONAL PARK AND BUFFER ZONE\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2016, The Partners Nepal initiated the \"Community-based Alpine Conservation and Restoration Project\" in Pangboche, with initial funding from Sir Edmund Hillary Stiftung Deutschland in Germany. The primary aim of this project was to preserve and rehabilitate the delicate alpine ecosystems of Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone in the Mount Everest region. The area's degradation has occurred due to excessive grazing, the excessive harvesting of alpine shrubs for fuelwood, and inadequate conservation practices. Additionally, global warming and climate change have had a particularly negative impact on the Khumbu region, which includes Mt. Everest. Similarly, to alleviate the consequences of climate change, a key strategy for adapting to climate change is to maximize tree planting in various locations. \n\n \n\nThe Partners Nepal understands the critical importance. Forests are essential for the maintenance of life on our planet. Forests provide crucial advantages such as unpolluted air, diverse ecosystems, and sources of income for millions of people around the globe. Under the guidance of Dr. Les Omotani, we effectively proceeded with the cultivation of indigenous trees in Khunde village, situated at an elevation of 3840m. Tree planting offers a multitude of benefits to both the environment and the local community. The program fosters cooperation among Sherpa communities, tourists, the government, benefactors [such as the Omotani Caring Foundation], and organizations to safeguard alpine ecosystems. Community members can contribute to forest preservation by participating in the exchange of information.\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n   \n\n2.          IN CHESKAM VILLAGE, THE PARTNERS NEPAL SUPPORTS COMMUNITY PONDS AS CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION\n\n \n\nIn 2023, The Partners Nepal constructed a community pond in Chheskam, Mahakulung Rural Municipality-1, Solukhumbu, to mitigate the effects of climate change. Climate adaptation requires the utilization of a communal pond. As global communities work towards sustainable solutions for climate change, initiatives such as these are vital milestones towards a more resilient future. This community pond is crucial to adapting to climate change and enhancing environmental resilience. By establishing and upkeeping these miniature aquatic habitats, we actively contribute to reducing global warming, preserving ecosystems, and promoting community involvement in conservation endeavors. Conserving these areas enhances, broadens, and stabilizes the ecological reactions to climate change. Climate change is responsible for droughts and storms, which require the implementation of water management strategies. Effective management of rainwater through neighborhood ponds can help mitigate droughts. Let us persist in advocating for creative solutions and environmentally friendly practices to benefit our planet and future generations.\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n  \n   \n  \n\n   \n\n \n\n3.          SIR EDMUND HILLARY MEMORIAL AND ELDERLY CARE CENTER IN BUNG\n\n \n\nIn 2016, we received a request from the residents of Bung to assist in conserving and revitalizing a building damaged by the earthquake in 2015. In 1989, Sir Edmund Hillary constructed a clinic in this village to offer healthcare services to the local community, who previously had to travel a considerable distance to reach either Phaplu Hospital or Khunde Hospital, also established by Sir Edmund Hillary. Thanks to financial assistance from the Sir Edmund Hillary Stiftung Deutschland, The Partners Nepal has successfully reconstructed the clinic that was devastated by the earthquake in 2015. Additionally, they have provided extensive aid in the form of shelters for elderly citizens who lack caretakers.\n\nThanks to the financial assistance provided by Drs. Les and Barbara Omotani: The Omotani Caring Foundation, we have utilized the funds to procure therapy equipment for the Elderly Care Centre. Individuals utilize the Nuga Best Massage Bed for therapeutic purposes and relaxation. It aids in maintaining proper spinal alignment, promotes muscle relaxation, and facilitates blood purification. Korean Jade Spine Heating Mats and massage beds are essential as acupressure benefits one's well-being. Massage therapy has the potential to alleviate stress, anxiety, and tension, relax muscles, reduce chronic pain, and enhance blood circulation. As mentioned earlier, providing seniors with the Nuga Best Massage Bed or Therapy will facilitate their acquisition of the advantages.",

The porters who live in small villages near Bwindi make it possible for many, many visitors to successfully trek to be among the mountain gorillas in the bamboo rainforest.  With their wonderful assistance the task of trekking the trails and hiking up and down the hills and trails is made easier, possible and even enjoyable!\n\n \n\nDuring the shutdown in tourism that began in 2020 the OCF donated and distributed food and soap to many of the local porters.  This new project is an effort to provide a new source of independence for the porters.\n\n \n\nThis project will be coordinated with the support of the Rafiki Memorial Wildlife Conservation Initiative.\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://rafikiwildlife.org/nyambishamba-porters/\n\n \n\nhttp://rafikiwildlife.org/\n\n \n\nKoen Von Rompay and  Mushamba Moses and Tweheyo Robert are willing to provide the financial oversight for this small project.   Paul Kirui will serve as an advisor for this project.\n\n \n\nThe OCF will  provide small annual grants to purchase bees and chickens. A few of the porters, such as Byamukama Milton,  have already established 35 bee hives that are producing honey.  This project will start with one porter association [Bwindi Nyambishamba  (Bujengwe)  Porters Association] and if the first project is successful, we may expand to include members of additional porter associations in the future.  \n\n \n\nThe project should promote additional porters and Batwa being trained and obtaining certificates in bee keeping and chickens and poultry.\n\n \n\nByamukama Milton has certificates in bee keeping and chickens.\n\nByaruhanga Denis has a certificate in chickens/poultry.\n\nMsuinguzi Julius is senior in bee keeping.\n\nNiwagaba Agry has certificate in chickens.\n\n \n\nBatwa Budara Fred is an expert in bee keeping.\n\n \n\nPhase one of this project will focus upon the Nyamishamba [Bujengwe] Porters association.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe project plan is for 75% of net profit from sales benefit the members of the Nyamishamba [Bujengwe] porters association.  They will use this funding to sustain their new activities of bee keeping and raising chickens.  They may also use the funds to support their children attending school and for the general support of their families.\n\nApproximately 20% of the net profit from sales saved to a fund for future purchases for all four  porter associations.  A minimum amount [less than 5%] will be allocated for local training, management and accounting costs provided by staff of the Rafiki Memorial Wildlife Conservation Initiative.\n\n \n\nThe Bwindi Nyamishamba Porters Association is located in the village of Nyamishamba, in the parish of Bujengwe, sub county of Kayonza in the District of Kanungu, Uganda.\n\n \n\nhttp://rafikiwildlife.org/nyambishamba-porters/\n\n \n\n \n\n1.

The farming will be in phases, the first phase will be land preparation followed by clearing and planting seedlings of different types of crops. \n\nPreparation of land is the first step, as it’s a new farmland containing strong grass, it will require the need of a digging tractor that has to dig deep underground for a very good farm and suitable growth of crops.\n\nLand clearing will involve using hand hoes and manual labor to clear and remove some particles that are hardly seen by the digging tractor. It will also involve leveling and mapping different parts specifically for a certain type of crop\n\nAfter clearing and making partials, planting of seeds and stems will start, for the first phase of crops will include maize, beans, cassava and sweet potatoes as we continue learning the fertility and best crops for the farm \n\nProject coordinated by Rafiki Memorial Wildlife Conservation Initiative\n\nMushamba Moses and Tweheyo Robert and Koen Van Rompay [Sahaya International]\n\nSponsored by the OMOTANI CARING FOUNDATION\n\n                        OMOTANICARINGFOUNDATION.COM",

      "content": "Throughout the world we get to meet individuals who are making a significant difference in sustaining the endangered wildlife in our rainforests, oceans and remote islands.  Our travels to the Borneo rainforest, in October of 2022,   were focused upon finding orangutans in their natural habitat.   What we discovered was many local people engaged in small but important efforts to protect and sustain several endangered species.  We also continued to find amazing efforts to provide all children with a quality education.\n\n \n\nWe were impressed with the efforts of the Turtle Nest Adoption program at Sabah Parks.  \n\nhttps://www.sabahparks.org.my/turtle-islands-park/turtle-conservation\n\n \n\nWe also were happy to meet Dr. Wong Siew Te at his Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Center where 42 rescued bears are in residence.  Dr Wong received his education and training in Taiwan and Montana, USA.    https://www.bsbcc.org.my/index.html\n\n \n\nWe also met local people who are involved in the reforestation of Borneo.  Each day they encourage 20-100 visitors to plant individual bamboo shoots or culms.  Each week thousands of new trees are given a new life!\n\n \n\nAnd finally, our immersion in the Borneo Rainforest at Danum Valley provided us with an amazing opportunity to discover the numerous species of plants and animals, with 340 species of birds, 124 species of mammals, 72 species of reptiles, and 56 species of amphibians. The valley is considered a true biodiversity hotspot, with several rare and endangered species, including the Bornean Orangutan, the Pygmy Elephant, the Clouded Leopard, and the Proboscis Monkey. The forest is also home to over 15,000 species of plants, including the world's tallest tropical tree, and 94% of the plant species in Danum Valley are from the dipterocarp genus, with many of these species being endemic to Borneo.   Being able to learn from local guides and biologists who have lived their lives in this environment reinforced our desire to take small steps to support the amazing work of dedicated local people.",

      "content": "We have completed the purchase of approximately 10 acres of farm land near Kihihi, Uganda.\n\nFour Batwa settlements will be involved with the farming activities of this farm.  Tweheyo Robert of the Bwindi Batwa Farm Project  will provide leadership and training for the new farm project near Kihihi.\n\nDuring the pandemic the Omotani Caring Foundation purchased, donated and distributed food supplies to the students and teachers at the Bwindi Plus Orphanage School, members of the local porters associations and also families in nearby Batwa settlements.  Initially it was hoped that this food scarcity would only last a few months.  In reality the need lasted several years and there continue to be challenges in 2022 and beyond.\n\nDiscussions with members of four Batwa settlements led to a shared agreement that it would be desirable to purchase a productive 10-acre farm and engage members of each community in the farming activities of the farm.  The ability to grow and harvest two crops every year will help to create an improved food security and sustainable source of food for the future.  Each settlement and the Bwindi Plus Orphanage School will benefit from the harvesting of the farm’s crops.\n\n The purchase of this farm land has been completed with the support and continued partnership with the Rafiki Wildlife Conservation Initiative and the Sahaya International Foundation.   The positive collaboration that continues to exist and grow to support everyone in the Bwindi-Buhoma villages is yielding very positive results.\n\n \n\n The farm land and the farming will involve different settlement areas\n of the Batwa that includes:\n\n 1.       KIBIRANGWE SETTLEMENT\n  The settlement will be presented by the following Batwa leaders and elders\n •         Kanyamugara Geoffrey-  Leader of the settlement\n •         Nyakwezi Robinah—Settlement elder\n •         Moreen and Joel -- Batwa youth\n \n 2.       NYABISIIKA SETLLEMENT\n  The following Batwa leaders and elders will represent the settlement\n •         Nyamishana Norah – Leader of the settlement\n •         George Zankaro – Settlement elder\n •         Kahingano George—Elder\n \n 3.       MUKONGORO SETTLEMENT\n  Representatives will be\n •         Bukyebe Geoffrey—Leader of settlement\n •         Madawa Jackson—Youth\n •         Barekwe Flora – Elder\n \n 4.       KAREHE SETTLEMENT\n  The representatives will be\n •         Mukombe and Jackson – Settlement leaders\n •         Nyinaburo Ruth – Youth \n\n \nThe Batwa Farm Project at Kihihi is located at Kanyanaburimano  Kibimbiri,  Kihihi, approximately 500 meters from the main road going to Kasese.  The farm land is approximately 10 acres and has been producing high value productive crops.\n\nThe new farm project will be modeled after the successful activities of the existing Bwindi Batwa Farm project.\n\nhttp://rafikiwildlife.org/bwindi-batwa-farm/",

Some of the awards she has received are:\n\n2019 Kyes Award for Excellence in Outreach, American Society of Primatologists, Top 250 NANPA Photography Showcase 2020, 2021,\n\nSemi-finalist, Nature’s Best Photography 2017 and 2020 and\n\nSemi-finalist, Mkapa African Wildlife Photography Awards 2021\n\n \n\nPHOTOGRAPHY INSPIRING CHILDREN IN CONSERVATION [PICC] was founded on the concept of engaging with the natural world through visual arts, focusing their work in primate habitat countries. The program goal is to build local capacity and inspire students to become conservation leaders within their communities by providing them with knowledge of primate ecology, as well as local conservation issues and solutions.  PICC program students gain skills in photography, illustration, and storytelling, providing an effective foundation upon which they may seek conservation-oriented careers. Kathy is excited about the post-pandemic future of introducing PICC’s  programs  with the children and teachers of the Bwindi school(s) and working on conservation efforts for mountain gorillas, chimpanzees and other endangered wildlife.\n\nPICC staff will guide the Bwindi  students and teachers  into  the bamboo rainforest to learn about the wildlife, how to photograph and sketch plants and animals, and how to make scientific notes in their notebooks. Using technology and equipment permanently provided to the school, these children will continue to make photographs and drawings and share their new knowledge and passion with their communities about how to protect the mountain gorillas, other wildlife and the Bwindi Impenetrable National Forest.\n\nFor questions, contact Kathy at\nPICC.director@gmail.com\n\nPhotography Inspiring Children in Conservation (501(c)(3)): (85-0519766):  PICCmadagascar.org\n\nRead about some of PICC’s projects in Madagascar: https://piccmadagascar.org/picc/projects \n\nConservation Stories: \nkathyweststudios.com/conservation-and-natural-history-stories/",
